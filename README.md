# ðŸŽ²random-standupðŸŽ²
Do you have awkward pauses in your standups because no one wants to give their
update next? Why not have a defined order? To make it fair, why not also
ðŸŽ²randomizeðŸŽ² that order!

## Usage

1. Get the tool with `go install github.com/jidicula/random-standup@latest`

2. Create a team roster in a TOML file, following the format in
`example-roster.toml`:
```toml
[Subteam-1]
members = [
        "Alice",                # TOML spec allows whitespace to break arrays
        "Bob",
        "Carol",
        "David"
        ]

["Subteam 2"]                   # Keys can have whitespace in quoted strings
members = ["Erin", "Frank", "Grace", "Heidi"]

["Empty Subteam"]               # Subteam with 0 members won't be printed

["Subteam 3"]
members = [
        "Ivan",
        "Judy",
        "Mallory",
        "Niaj"
]
```

3. `random-standup example-roster.toml`
