# ðŸŽ²random-standupðŸŽ²
Do you have awkward pauses in your standups because no one wants to give their
update next? Why not have a defined order? To make it fair, why not also
ðŸŽ²randomizeðŸŽ² that order!

## Usage

1. Build the tool with `go build -o random-standup`

2. Create a team roster in a TOML file, following the format in
`example-roster.toml`:
```toml
[Subteam-1]
members = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "David"]

[Subteam-2]
members = ["Erin", "Frank", "Grace", "Heidi"]
```

3. `./random-standup example-roster.toml`

## Output
```
$ ./random-standup example-roster.toml
# 2021-03-21
## Subteam-1
David
Bob
Carol
Alice

## Subteam-2
Frank
Erin
Heidi
Grace
```
